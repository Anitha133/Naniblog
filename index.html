                        Director Mohan Krishna Indraganti noticed Nani in an advertisement and offered him a role in the aforementioned film <b>Ashta Chamma</b>, also starring Swati Reddy. Ashta Chamma was well received by critics and Nani's performance was praised by them. He has good emotions and dances well, though his body language sometimes reminds of Subhalekha Sudhakar - May this be treated as a compliment to the ease that the veteran actor shows on the screen! His addiction is good too.

                        Whenever I've tasted success, I always remind myself there's going to be a day I'll get failures again. I am practical like that; I did not land here overnight. All I can do is continue to work hard and give my best. It's important to enjoy your work and I love cinema. I am lucky to wake up every day to do what I love.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nani speaks at length about the idea of success, and how he takes it as a personal responsibility. He elaborates, “I want to know every detail behind my films success, whether everyone made money or not. If not, then it's not a success for me. I am the one who is interacting with every department, so I know what's happening with all of them. If the whole town is calling my film a superhit but two territories lost money, it keeps bothering me.” Nani also recalls instances when he went back to some distributors, who had earlier lost money on his films, to give them a chance to recover their costs. “Success is not an information people give you. At the end of the day, in your head, you should know if you are successful or not. That satisfaction lasts longer,” the actor reflects, as he signs off.
